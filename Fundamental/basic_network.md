# Basic Networking Concepts

**1. What is Networking?**

Networking is the practice of connecting multiple computing devices to share resources, information, and services. It facilitates communication between devices such as computers, servers, smartphones, and more.

**2. IP Address and Subnetting**

* **IP Address:** An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. 
    * IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
    * IPv6 (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

* **Subnetting:** Dividing an IP network into smaller sub-networks for improved performance and security.

**3. MAC Address**

* A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a hardware address assigned to a network interface card. It's unique to each device.

**4. Protocols**

* **TCP/IP:** Suite of communication protocols for connecting hosts on the internet.
* **HTTP/HTTPS:** Protocols for transferring data over the internet. HTTPS is secured.
* **FTP/SFTP:** Protocols for transferring files over a network.
* **SMTP/POP3/IMAP:** Protocols for sending and receiving emails.

**5. Ports**

* Virtual endpoints used for communication between different processes on a network.

**6. Firewalls and Routers**

* **Firewall:** Security device that filters network traffic.
* **Router:** Networking device that forwards data packets between networks.

**7. DNS (Domain Name System)**

* Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses.

**8. OSI Model**

* Conceptual framework for understanding network interactions.
